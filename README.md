MagSense: Unlocking 6 Degrees of Freedom with Infineon solution

## 3D-Mouse Project Repository

This repository is used to store all code and files related to the 3D Mouse demo.

The project includes:

- Hardware design files
- Sensor and fusion algorithm code
- Arduino/MTB example code
- Related documentation and instructions

## Folder Structure Explanation

- `arduino/`: Arduino example code for interfacing with sensors and demonstrating basic functionality.
- `fusion/`: Python scripts and related files for sensor data fusion and movement processing.
- `hardware/`: Hardware design files, such as schematics and wiring diagrams (e.g., Fritzing files).
- `mtb/`: PSoC (ModusToolbox) project files, source code, build scripts, and board support packages for firmware development.

Refer to the README file in each folder for detailed instructions on how to run the code and use the resources.

Please use this repository to find and maintain all resources related to the 3D Mouse demo.
